## Why I chose Node.js

-[node-persist](https://github.com/simonlast/node-persist): I chose node persist to keep persistent data

-[node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github): I chose to use node-github because it provided a nice wrapper to the Github API for Node.js

-[mocha](https://mochajs.org/): I chose mocha for a test framework for its simplicity.

-[chai & chai-http](http://chaijs.com/): I chose chai to help with testing as an assertion library. I also used chai-http to test my routes for the web app.
